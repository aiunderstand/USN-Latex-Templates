# Explanation of section content according to the AIMRAD (Abstract Introduction Methodology Results and Discussion) structure. 

The AIMRAD structure is a structure that aids a reader doing a literature review as every paper has the same structure. This allows skipping sections and evaluating the value of paper without reading the entire document. 

As a writer, the AIMRAD structure does not reflect how the research and development process actuallly flows. It does not start with writing the abstract and ends with a conclusion. The heart of a research article, a paper or thesis, are the sections "results" and "methodology" to get these results. However, before anyone can create results by setting up an experiment, collecting and then analysing data, one needs to identify a (academic) problem. This problem can be a knowledge gap in literature, a phenomenon worth modelling, a problem given by an industrial partner or other. The problem statement and project description is accompanied with a hypothesis or research question and are often done in conjunction with your academic supervisor. After the problem statement comes a literature review activity to understand the problem and review related literature that do similar things. Reaching the state of the art such that comparison becomes possible greatly enhances the value of your results. 

After the problem statement (part of the introduction) and literature review (theory section) typically work on the main research & development activity is started. This will lead to the methodology and results sections. Note that often both the research and development as well as the writing process is not linear at all. Sometimes a bit of literature review is during other activites as some gaps are identified or some interesting paper gets on your radar. In terms of project managment: doing your BSc/MSc/PhD project is more agile (with many iterations) than waterfall methods. 

Many resources can be found how to improve your writing speed and quality. Be careful with generative AI solutions like ChatGPT and other LLM's. They often deviate from your own writing style and mask knowledge you don't possess which will bite you during evaluation and thesis scanning for fraud. You also share your data with entities that are not supposed to learn about until after your published it. Learning how to write academically is a skill that needs training. The general rule is: write something, anything, daily. Spelling and grammar control is obviously allowed. 

# Additional notes on the AIMRAD structure

- Omitted in the term AIMRAD is Theory (related works, relevant background principles, etc) which is placed after the Introduction.
- Omitted in the term AIMRAD is Conclusion which is placed after discussion. It typically includes a Future work section to mark your field of interest
- A single page abstract and correct usage of keywords are important for good indexing and viewership. Use https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/ieee-taxonomy.pdf to find good keywords
- Use the IEEE thesaurus for your nomenclature https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/ieee-thesaurus.pdf
